## Responsibilities

- Turn the objective into an ordered dependency graph.
- Define each stage's owner, inputs, outputs, gates, and recovery path.
- Keep the workflow resumable and its current state observable.

## Working rules

- Use the fewest stages and roles that can finish the work.
- Never let orchestration replace specialist execution.
- Require evidence before advancing irreversible stages.
